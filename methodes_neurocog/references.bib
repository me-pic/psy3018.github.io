               component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal
               resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF
               hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for
               specific clinical applications. RF coils are the ``antennas'' of
               the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the
               magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second
               to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit
               RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1+) to rotate the net
               magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic
               field (B0 ), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization.
               Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the
               magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( B1-) changes, which
               generates a current I. This signal is ``picked-up'' by an
               antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower
               frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally
               reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive
               functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This
               review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil
               from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and

              and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the
              many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols,
              comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this
              barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an

              parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this
              commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the
              associated key challenges involved in its development. These
              include differences among existing anatomical reference
              materials, striking the right balance between reliability of
              measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a
              versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of
              populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines
              these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each,
              with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two
              examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once
              completed, is expected to impact the field by producing
              measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and
              by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different
              studies. \copyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

               volumes and volume change during follow-up intervals of 12 or 24

              Neonate magnetic resonance (MR) images have different contrasts

              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can thus be considered

              most anatomical regions are identifiable and thus amenable to
              manual segmentation. In the current study, we developed a
              protocol for segmenting the amygdala and hippocampus in
              T2-weighted neonatal MR images. The participants were 31 healthy
              infants between 2 and 5 weeks of age. Intra-rater reliability was
              measured in 12 randomly selected MR images, where 6 MR images
              were segmented at 1-month intervals between the delineations, and
              another 6 MR images at 6-month intervals. The protocol was also
              tested by two independent raters in 20 randomly selected

              and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger
              tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated
              trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s
              and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to
              be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be
              predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular
              function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response
              varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this
              character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon
              model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to
              concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different
              temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the
              measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
              individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was
              found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual
              rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the
              response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is
              effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The
              deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a
              short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may
              be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal

              responses in eventrelated fMRI.",

               anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater
               activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This
               finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a
               network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this
               study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this
               hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human
               brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is
               it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these
               questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased
               activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined
               their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly
               coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in
               the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional
               connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and
               show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually
               identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three
               lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the
               cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We
               report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral

               attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive

               fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the

               blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often
               synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon
               termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is
               widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of
               fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks.
               Despite the large body of human imaging literature on
               spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting
               state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous.
               Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological
               recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations
               in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying
               locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with
               time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a
               traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at
               approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were
               reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either
               the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power
               changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the
               local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation
               between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal
               activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of
               correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in
               widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were
               significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single
               recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be
               generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based
               functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting

               external attention and are active during remembering,
               envisioning the future and making social inferences. This Review
               describes progress in understanding the organization and
               function of networks embedded within these association regions.
               Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest
               that the default network is not a single network, as
               historically described, but instead comprises multiple
               interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common
               organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque
               anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of
               processing function dependent on internally constructed rather
               than externally constrained representations, with each separate
               interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain.
               Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence
               for competitive relationships between the internally and

              show significant differences across the active task states within
              an experiment, but a verb-generation task produced larger
              decreases than a read task in right and left inferior parietal

               challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity
               will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a
               baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the
               brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as
               the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by
               flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting
               state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations
               in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of
               changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during
               a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative
               metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission
               tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain.
               Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All
               significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were
               increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost
               exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of
               an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that

              interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity
              suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations

              particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of
              large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In
              this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was
              explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data
              from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based
              alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and
              replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the
              cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to
              sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of
              association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices,
              functional connectivity followed topographic representations
              across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity
              patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network
              boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand
              properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor
              pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal
              area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye
              field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within
              and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the
              MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with
              a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional
              connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was
              next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring
              regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that,
              while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within
              largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by
              discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral
              networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential
              evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.",

  author   = "Ridgway, John P",
  abstract = "There are many excellent specialised texts and articles that
              describe the physical principles of cardiovascular magnetic
              resonance (CMR) techniques. There are also many texts written
              with the clinician in mind that provide an understandable, more
              general introduction to the basic physical principles of magnetic
              resonance (MR) techniques and applications. There are however
              very few texts or articles that attempt to provide a basic MR
              physics introduction that is tailored for clinicians using CMR in
              their daily practice. This is the first of two reviews that are
              intended to cover the essential aspects of CMR physics in a way
              that is understandable and relevant to this group. It begins by
              explaining the basic physical principles of MR, including a
              description of the main components of an MR imaging system and
              the three types of magnetic field that they generate. The origin
              and method of production of the MR signal in biological systems
              are explained, focusing in particular on the two tissue
              magnetisation relaxation properties (T1 and T2) that give rise to
              signal differences from tissues, showing how they can be
              exploited to generate image contrast for tissue characterisation.
              The method most commonly used to localise and encode MR signal
              echoes to form a cross sectional image is described, introducing
              the concept of k-space and showing how the MR signal data stored
              within it relates to properties within the reconstructed image.
              Before describing the CMR acquisition methods in detail, the
              basic spin echo and gradient pulse sequences are introduced,
              identifying the key parameters that influence image contrast,
              including appearances in the presence of flowing blood,
              resolution and image acquisition time. The main derivatives of
              these two pulse sequences used for cardiac imaging are then
              described in more detail. Two of the key requirements for CMR are
              the need for data acquisition first to be to be synchronised with
              the subject's ECG and to be fast enough for the subject to be
              able to hold their breath. Methods of ECG synchronisation using
              both triggering and retrospective gating approaches, and
              accelerated data acquisition using turbo or fast spin echo and
              gradient echo pulse sequences are therefore outlined in some
              detail. It is shown how double inversion black blood preparation
              combined with turbo or fast spin echo pulse sequences acquisition
              is used to achieve high quality anatomical imaging. For
              functional cardiac imaging using cine gradient echo pulse
              sequences two derivatives of the gradient echo pulse sequence;
              spoiled gradient echo and balanced steady state free precession
              (bSSFP) are compared. In each case key relevant imaging
              parameters and vendor-specific terms are defined and explained.",

	abstract = {The increasing environmental footprint of the information and communication technology sector calls for innovative strategies for assessing and improving its sustainability. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are suitable for estimating the negative environmental impacts of products or services. While some LCA methods start to be applied during the engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), some challenges remain unresolved. For instance, the energy consumption, and therefore the greenhouse gas emissions, of CPS is influenced by the specific configuration of components in their architecture, as well as by the geographical location where the components are deployed. Also, the skills and efforts required by LCA projects, remain prohibitive to many CPS engineering projects. This paper presents an LCA-based method tailored for CPS that facilitates the analysis of the environmental impact and the comparison of architectural and location variants. Moreover, we have developed a supporting tool that guides the process and automates part of the data collection activity. Through an illustrative case and expert assessment, we have been able to assess the benefits and drawbacks of our proposal. With these contributions, we hope to lower the barrier to adopting LCA practices in CPS engineering projects, both in industry and academia.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a key tool to assess the environmental impact of product systems. Two prominent types are attributional (ALCA; assessment of the global impact share of a product life cycle) and consequential LCA (CLCA; assessment of the consequential impact of a decision). We analysed to which extent they are of relevance for society and can support decision-making based on two ideological and three pragmatic criteria. First, when it comes to realistic modelling as desired in the context of sustainable development, in theory, CLCA attempts to project these realistically, whereas ALCA falls short to a certain degree because of conceptual constraints. Concerning the second criterion of alignment with ethics, CLCA aligns completely with omnipresent consequential ethics, where an action is judged based on the consequences it causes. ALCA is only partially consequential, as it is restricted by conceptual rules relating with deontological ethics, and for example even covers the relative past of the product. Since deontological ethics, i.e. judging an action based on its alignment with rules, are in general of relevance for our modern human society, there is room for complementarity in ethical relevance between ALCA and CLCA. However, the rules of ALCA (e.g. additivity) and their relevance have not been society-wide accepted. In the context of decision-support, CLCA would evaluate the consequences of decisions and ALCA covers the approval \& sharing of potential responsibility of the life cycle environmental impact of the product associated with the decision. We also point out a unique valorisation for Organisational ALCA, covering the latter for the organizations behind a product. Concerning the three practical criteria, , modelling complexity and uncertainty may often be only slightly higher for CLCA than for ALCA due to a consideration of change caused by a decision, but both ALCA and CLCA modelling may be similarly complex and uncertain as both methods cover past and/or future projections. Finally, ALCA modelling may be seen as a practical approximation of CLCA, but current CLCA models are more adequate to study consequential effects, and the further CLCA modelling and databases improve, the more this will be the case.},

This includes its enormous demand for electricity compared to other imaging modalities and contamination of water bodies with anthropogenic gadolinium related to contrast administration. Given the pressing threat of climate change, addressing these challenges to improve the environmental sustainability of MRI is imperative. The purpose of this review is to discuss the challenges, opportunities, and the need for action to reduce the environmental impact of MRI and prepare for the effects of climate change. The approaches outlined are categorized as strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from MRI during production and use phases, approaches to reduce the environmental impact of MRI including the preservation of finite resources, and development of adaption plans to prepare for the impact of climate change. Co-benefits of these strategies are emphasized including lower GHG emission and reduced cost along with improved heath and patient satisfaction. Although MRI is energy-intensive, there are many steps that can be taken now to improve the environmental sustainability of MRI and prepare for the effects of climate change. On-going research, technical development, and collaboration with industry partners are needed to achieve further reductions in MRI-related GHG emissions and to decrease the reliance on finite resources.

Over the past years, developing and applying more energy efficient cooling strategies to reduce the environmental footprint and the total cost of ownership of data centers has drawn considerable attention. Cooling systems with air-side economizer cycle provide one of the most efficient methods. Their effectiveness in terms of energy and exergy, and the environmental and economical impact have been analyzed quantitatively in this research. Since the effectiveness highly depends on the local climate conditions, the analysis has been carried out for 23 locations across Australia. First, a detailed cooling load of the data center has been estimated by considering the workload and heat generation characteristics of the running IT equipment. Then, a comprehensive energy, exergy, environment and economic model of nine different air-side economizer cycles has been developed. Finally, the effectiveness and profitability of each economizer cycle has been compared to a conventional cooling system by evaluating the annual and monthly saving potential at each location. The air-side economizers can yield maximum savings of 84\%, 80\%, 75\% and 85\% in the annual cooling energy consumption, exergy destruction, CO2 emission and cooling costs, respectively. The power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the data centers can be also reduced from an average of 1.42 to 1.22. These savings and efficiency enhancements are highly correlated with the type and geographic location of the air-side economizers. In general, the saving potential increases as we move further south in Australia, due to more favorable climate conditions.},

The study builds on a high number of data sources including measured and reported data from 150 companies that is estimated to cover about 80\% of network subscriptions, about 55\% of data center electricity, and about 35\% of upstream GHG emissions. To understand the development, the results are put into the perspective of earlier studies. In conclusion, the ICT sector used about 4\% of the global electricity in the use stage and represented about 1.4\% of the global GHG emissions in 2020. The use stage electricity consumption and the total GHG emissions have increased since 2015, but the impact per subscription has decreased. The user devices accounted for over half of all GHG emissions, with equal parts relating to use stage and other lifecycle stages. For networks and data centers, the use stage GHG emissions are dominating. The electricity consumption and GHG emissions are also estimated for the closely related areas Entertainment and Media (including e.g., TVs), paper media, and cryptocurrencies.},

We measured the carbon footprint of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) preprocessing tool fMRIPrep, testing the effect of varying parameters on estimated carbon emissions and preprocessing performance. Performance was quantified using (a) statistical individual-level task activation in regions of interest and (b) mean smoothness of preprocessed data. Eight variants of fMRIPrep were run with 257 participants who had completed an fMRI stop signal task (the same data also used in the original validation of fMRIPrep). Some variants led to substantial reductions in carbon emissions without sacrificing data quality: for instance, disabling FreeSurfer surface reconstruction reduced carbon emissions by 48\%. We provide six recommendations for minimising emissions without compromising performance. By varying parameters and computational resources, neuroimagers can substantially reduce the carbon footprint of their preprocessing. This is one aspect of our research carbon footprint over which neuroimagers have control and agency to act upon.},

Overall, fMRIPrep demonstrated slightly superior statistical sensitivity to both FSL and SPM, with FSL also outperforming SPM. However, this pattern varied by brain region. Researchers analysing fMRI data can use these findings to inform their choice of software package, considering the carbon footprint of data processing alongside usability and quality of derived output.

	abstract = {Research is an energy and resource-demanding activity. However, despite increasing awareness and emerging sustainability initiatives, a paucity of data and methodological inconsistency continue to hamper effective and accountable emissions mitigation. With {\textgreater} 250,000 doctoral students graduating annually across all academic disciplines, empowering PhD students to engage in carbon accounting could provide a sizable and robust source of carbon data alongside a powerful generational force for decarbonisation. Here, we demonstrate how doctoral students and other researchers can consistently measure the carbon footprint of their work, using one PhD student’s research in a neuroscience Drosophila lab as our case study. We present a comprehensive life-cycle assessment of the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e) generated by the student’s research activities, including measurement of scope 1 emissions associated with Drosophila husbandry; calculation of time- and region-specific scope 2 emissions produced by widely used techniques including calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics; and estimation of scope 3 emissions associated with procurement and research-related travel. We found that research-related travel and procurement of laboratory supplies were responsible for the majority of annual emissions, up to 1942 kg CO2e and 543 kg CO2e respectively after accounting for aircraft radiative forcing. Using NESO’s open-source Carbon Intensity API to account for temporal and geographical variation in the carbon intensity of UK National Grid energy, we found that persistent laboratory energy consumption released 10.99 kg CO2e, with an additional 3.56 kg CO2e scope 2 and 3.6 kg CO2e scope 1 emissions underpinning direct research activities. Finally, we discuss the challenges of accurately carbon foot printing research across disciplines in the UK and beyond, highlighting the value of regionally precise open-source energy mix data and the need for data openness within research supply chains. Overall, we present a common framework for including carbon footprint analyses as ‘Carbon Appendices’ to PhD theses to generate carbon footprint data across disciplines. Beyond the benefits of such data for informed emissions mitigation, we envision doctoral students carrying insights from carbon appendices forward into academia and industry to catalyse a community-driven decarbonisation of the research sector.},

	abstract = {Growth in aviation contributes more to global warming than is generally appreciated because of the mix of climate pollutants it generates. Here, we model the CO2 and non-CO2 effects like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation to analyse aviation’s total warming footprint. Aviation contributed approximately 4\% to observed human-induced global warming to date, despite being responsible for only 2.4\% of global annual emissions of CO2. Aviation is projected to cause a total of about 0.1 °C of warming by 2050, half of it to date and the other half over the next three decades, should aviation’s pre-COVID growth resume. The industry would then contribute a 6\%–17\% share to the remaining 0.3 °C–0.8 °C to not exceed 1.5 °C–2 °C of global warming. Under this scenario, the reduction due to COVID-19 to date is small and is projected to only delay aviation’s warming contribution by about five years. But the leveraging impact of growth also represents an opportunity: aviation’s contribution to further warming would be immediately halted by either a sustained annual 2.5\% decrease in air traffic under the existing fuel mix, or a transition to a 90\% carbon-neutral fuel mix by 2050.},

Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including data centers and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many important scientific milestones are achieved thanks to the development of high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to contextualize GHG emissions are defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms (www.green-algorithms.org) is developed, which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of hardware configurations. Finally, the GHG emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary CO2 emissions, the authors hope to raise awareness and facilitate greener computation.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging typically explores how a particular task activates a set of brain regions. Importantly though, the same neural system can be activated by inherently different tasks. To date, there is no approach available that systematically explores whether and how distinct tasks probe the same neural system. Here, we propose and validate an alternative framework, the Automatic Neuroscientist, which turns the standard fMRI approach on its head. We use real-time fMRI in combination with modern machine-learning techniques to automatically design the optimal experiment to evoke a desired target brain state. In this work, we present two proof-of-principle studies involving perceptual stimuli. In both studies optimization algorithms of varying complexity were employed; the first involved a stochastic approximation method while the second incorporated a more sophisticated Bayesian optimization technique. In the first study, we achieved convergence for the hypothesized optimum in 11 out of 14 runs in less than 10min. Results of the second study showed how our closed-loop framework accurately and with high efficiency estimated the underlying relationship between stimuli and neural responses for each subject in one to two runs: with each run lasting 6.3min. Moreover, we demonstrate that using only the first run produced a reliable solution at a group-level. Supporting simulation analyses provided evidence on the robustness of the Bayesian optimization approach for scenarios with low contrast-to-noise ratio. This framework is generalizable to numerous applications, ranging from optimizing stimuli in neuroimaging pilot studies to tailoring clinical rehabilitation therapy to patients and can be used with multiple imaging modalities in humans and animals.},

But what is this assumption based on, and how are we measuring value, power, and performance? And what are the collateral consequences of this race to ever-increasing scale? Here, we scrutinize the current scaling trends and trade-offs across multiple axes and refute two common assumptions underlying the ‘bigger-is-better’ AI paradigm: 1) that performance improvements are driven by increased scale, and 2) that all interesting problems addressed by AI require large-scale models. Rather, we argue that this approach is not only fragile scientifically, but comes with undesirable consequences. First, it is not sustainable, as, despite efficiency improvements, its compute demands increase faster than model performance, leading to unreasonable economic requirements and a disproportionate environmental footprint. Second, it implies focusing on certain problems at the expense of others, leaving aside important applications, e.g. health, education, or the climate. Finally, it exacerbates a concentration of power, which centralizes decision-making in the hands of a few actors while threatening to disempower others in the context of shaping both AI research and its applications throughout society.},

This has implied increasing amounts of monetary investment and natural resources. Frontier AI applications have thus resulted in rising financial, environmental, and social costs. While the factors that AI scaling depends on reach its limits, the push for its accelerated advancement and entrenchment continues. In this paper, we provide a holistic review of AI scaling using four lenses (technical, economic, ecological, and social) and review the relationships between these lenses to explore the dynamics of AI growth. We do so by drawing on system dynamics concepts including archetypes such as "limits to growth" to model the dynamic complexity of AI scaling and synthesize several perspectives. Our work maps out the entangled relationships between the technical, economic, ecological and social perspectives and the apparent limits to growth. The analysis explains how industry's responses to external limits enables continued (but temporary) scaling and how this benefits Big Tech while externalizing social and environmental damages. To avoid an "overshoot and collapse" trajectory, we advocate for realigning priorities and norms around scaling to prioritize sustainable and mindful advancements.},

The most feasible way to reach zero energy was found to be a free cooling system combined with a PV generator, which has the lowest payback period (PBP) of 6 years at minimum initial retrofit cost. The free cooling system resulted in 83\% reduction in cooling demand and an improvement in power usage effectiveness from 1.8 to 1.1. The PBP was also 6 years for a waste heat reuse system and for an outdoor location of the same DC, but with a higher initial cost than free cooling system.

Unfortunately, this particular focus has led to the emergence of supercomputers that consume egregious amounts of electrical power and produce so much heat that extravagant cooling facilities must be constructed to ensure proper operation. In addition, the emphasis on speed as the performance metric has caused other performance metrics to be largely ignored, e.g., reliability, availability, and usability. As a consequence, all of the above has led to an extraordinary increase in the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a supercomputer. Despite the importance of the TOP500 List, we argue that the list makes it much more difficult for the high-performance computing (UPC) community to focus on performance metrics other than speed. Therefore, to raise awareness to other performance metrics of interest, e.g., energy efficiency for improved reliability, we propose a Green500 List and discuss the potential metrics that would be used to rank supercomputing systems on such a list.},

Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research. This position paper advocates a practical solution by making efficiency an evaluation criterion for research alongside accuracy and related measures. In addition, we propose reporting the financial cost or "price tag" of developing, training, and running models to provide baselines for the investigation of increasingly efficient methods.

The system will be comprised of a compressor, to compress the gas to high pressure; a purifier to clean it; and a liquefier to return it to the liquid state which is necessary for NMR instruments. Also, piping and pressure controllers will be necessary to connect the helium from the NMR instruments with the gas collection bag. Finally, a door linking Otto Maass and Pulp and Paper will need to be widened to permit dewars to be brought from the collection area and the magnets. The idea of helium recovery is not novel in and of itself, and many commercial providers sell systems which can be used with our instrumentation. In fact, such a system exists within the laboratory of Guillaume Gervais in the Physics Department. However, it is too small to accept the amount of helium used by the NMR instruments in the Chemistry Department, and furthermore, transporting the helium to physics would be logistically difficult (it would be necessary to collect and compress the gas before it could be transported, and require special transportation to be moved). So, the technology would be novel within the context of the Chemistry Department, and complementary to the system in the Physics Department.

Research computing can have a substantial carbon footprint in cases where researchers employ computationally expensive processes with large amounts of data. Analysis of human neuroimaging data, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans, is one such case. Here, we consider ten ways in which those who conduct human neuroimaging research can reduce the carbon footprint of their research computing, by making adjustments to the ways in which studies are planned, executed, and analysed; as well as where and how data are stored.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) can achieve impressive results across a wide variety of tasks, but this often comes at the cost of training models for extensive periods on specialized hardware accelerators. This energy-intensive workload has seen immense growth in recent years. Machine learning (ML) may become a significant contributor to climate change if this exponential trend continues. If practitioners are aware of their energy and carbon footprint, then they may actively take steps to reduce it whenever possible. In this work, we present Carbontracker, a tool for tracking and predicting the energy and carbon footprint of training DL models. We propose that energy and carbon footprint of model development and training is reported alongside performance metrics using tools like Carbontracker. We hope this will promote responsible computing in ML and encourage research into energy-efficient deep neural networks.},

	abstract = {Due to its unique properties, helium is critical in scientific research and industrial innovation, particularly in cryogenics; however, its scarcity necessitates efficient resource utilization. Through a review of the historical development of the helium industry, this study comprehensively evaluates the value, sources, production methods, supply dynamics, and sustainability challenges of helium. The processes and mechanisms of helium enrichment, along with effective exploration methods, are systematically analyzed here. We recommend focusing on the development of technologies for helium preservation, recovery, and extraction, particularly the extraction technology for helium-poor fields. Market analysis indicates that no imminent crisis in the global helium supply is expected before 2060. Thus, enhancing helium resource protection technologies is essential to improve its economic utilization and management while providing a timely reference for the scientific community.},
