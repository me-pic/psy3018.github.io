## Usage

### building the book

If you want to contribute changes and check how the book renders, you need to:
- clone this repository.
- Run `pip install -r methods_cogneuro_book/requirements.txt` (it is recommended to run this instruction in a virtual environment).
- (Recommended) Clean the environment `jb clean methods-cogneuro-book/`
- Build the book `jb build methods-cogneuro-book/`

A static html version of the book will be generated in `methods-cogneuro-book/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

The html version of the book is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. Navigate to your local build and run,
- `ghp-import -n -p -f methods-cogneuro-book/_build/html`

This will automatically push your build to the `gh-pages` branch. More information on this hosting process can be found [here](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/gh-pages.html#manually-host-your-book-with-github-pages).

### Generating pdf

The support for pdf generation is experimental with jupyter book, and the output is not perfect. Currently the process looks like:
 * install the depencies described in the section "Building a pdf with latex" in the [jb docs](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/pdf.html).
 * build latex with individual pages: `jb build methods-cogneuro-book/ --builder pdflatex --individualpages`. This produces warnings (skip them) and errors. If you ever get stuck in the terminal, leaving the weird latex compilation environment is achieved by pressing `X` (you're welcome).
 * install xetex `sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex`
 * go in the build directory `cd methods-cogneuro-book/_build/latex`
 * edit manually the `tex` file of the chapter. Replace all `\chapter` by `\section` and add a proper `\chapter` at the beginning. You can also search `Content` and replace by `Table des matiÃ¨res`. I have tried to switch the whole doc in French but without success so far.
 * before adding the chapter title, add the following lines: `\setcounter{chapter}{n} \addtocounter{chapter}{-1}`, where `n` is the number of the chapter.
 * Compile a chapter, e.g. `xelatex cartes_cerebrales.tex`
 * the resulting pdf is mega-huge. So shrink it with `gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=notes_cours_cartes_cerebrales.pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook cartes_cerebrales.pdf`
 * VoilÃ  ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
